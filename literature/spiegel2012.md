# Promise

A tensor decomposition technique that can be used for link prediction in a dynamic graph. Focus on 3 dimensions (third-order tensor), where the first two can be the adjacency matrix and the third the time.

Practical results come from the CP (CanDecomp /ParaFac) technique, which is an approximation of the tensor decomposition.

Simple, effective. 

# Delivery

Simply written, delivers as promised.

Good introduction to tensor decomposition.

Supports dynamic graphs, but only in time: number of users or items doesn't change - only the connections between them. 

No extensions about adding/deleting nodes either.
