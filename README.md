# Pol.is Graph Theoretic Modeling (brief intro)

Pol.is is a deliberation platform where participants are called to vote (agree/disagree/pass) on a number of statements. At the same time, they are free to add their own statements for subsequent users to vote on.

This document aims to study the resulting poll from a graph theoretical point of view, and derive, if possible, useful analytical properties. 

Possible uses for this analysis are
* strengthening the polling process (e.g. resistance to coordinated voting attacks),
* suggesting directions of improvement,
* better understanding of the computational complexity of common actions,
* ...
