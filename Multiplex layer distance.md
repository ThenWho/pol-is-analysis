# Multiplex layer distance

[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab14b3](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab14b3)

Here the authors suggest that

1. if you use any type of centrality measure in each network layer (e.g. degree centrality for the positive-answers layer and 'inverse degree' centrality for the negative-answers) but convert it into 'rank'...
2. ... you can work in a unifying way over all layers and eg define a sort of distance Â between them.

In the polis' case, this could mean distance from an ideal unanimous consensus (everybody agrees on all statements). This isn't interesting (or realistic) as an absolute value but could be used to find statements that can make a big difference if they are improved (ie they decrease distance from 'unanimous consensus' more than others
