# Link prediction

## Generic method

Using participant-votes data, it is possible to predict future votes as follows:
* Use a tensor to store participant-votes data, one slice per positive/negative/pass votes.
* Use modified tensor decomposition such as CP to derive latent matrices, as follows:
    * When updating the elements of the latent matrices, evaluate their fitness using a weight matrix. The weight elements should be 
        * 1 when the observation is present in the same place in participant-votes data
        * 0 when the observation is missing (i.e. link to be predicted)
    * At the end of the update, the latent matrices would be optimized with respect to the missing observations.
* Recover the tensor from the latent matrices.
* The values in the missing observations contain the predicted links, if any.

## Optimized element- and slice-wise updates

While the above method works, it updates the full latent matrices every time. This is computentionally expensive, when only some elements/row/columns of some slice are updated. 

For example, this is the case when a participant submits one new vote on some statement. This vote changes one element in one of the slices (positive/negative/pass), but might change future link predictions for that participant. We would like to have a way to make partial updates to the latent matrices, without recalculating them from scratch.

This is possible by implementing the SCED algorithm of Zhou *et al*, together with the generic method above.
