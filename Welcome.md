Pol.isÂ is a deliberation platform where participants are called to vote (agree/disagree/pass) on a number of statements. At the same time, they are free to add their own statements for subsequent users to vote on<sup>[[1]](#ftnt-ref1)</sup>.

This document aims to study the resulting poll from a graph theoretical point of view, and derive, if possible, useful analytical properties. Possible uses for this analysis are

* strengthening the polling process (e.g. resistance to coordinated voting attacks),
* suggesting directions of improvement,
* better understanding of the computational complexity of common actions,
* ...
