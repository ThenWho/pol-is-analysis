| We use the following process to improve this doc :
|1. If you're reading this, you're welcome to contribute! ðŸŽ‰
|2. Work in suggestion mode.
|3. Make use of comments and ample +1s.
|4. Each section has a steward (in parenthesis).
|5. Accept/reject comments of the sections that you are steward of.
|6. To start working in a new direction:
|a. start a new section and
|b. put yourself as a steward. |


Pol.is[[1]](#ftnt1)Â is a deliberation platform where participants are called to vote (agree/disagree/pass) on a number of statements. At the same time, they are free to add their own statements for subsequent users to vote on<sup>[[2]](#ftnt2)</sup>.

This document aims to study the resulting poll from a graph theoretical point of view, and derive, if possible, useful analytical properties. Possible uses for this analysis are

* strengthening the polling process (e.g. resistance to coordinated voting attacks),
* suggesting directions of improvement,
* better understanding of the computational complexity of common actions,
* ...
